            <h1 id="mile">Key milestone</h1>
        <p id="stone">With 50 centuries in one-day internationals, Virat Kohli set a new record by surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's 49 centuries. The Master Blaster had held the record since September 1998 when he overtook Desmond Haynes' 17 centuries. As we celebrate this historic milestone, it's evident that Kohli's journey to success encompasses not only his incredible batting prowess but also his adept leadership.</p>
